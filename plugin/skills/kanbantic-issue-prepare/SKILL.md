# Kanbantic Issue Prepare

## Overview

`kanbantic-issue-prepare` works a Triaged issue all the way to a first-class **`Prepared`** status (KBT-F235). It is the **single entry point** for the Triaged → Prepared lane transition — regardless of whether the issue is a Feature, Bug, or Epic. Internally it dispatches on `issue.type` so the user never has to choose a sub-skill.

**Principle:** Read Triaged issue from Kanbantic → route on type → dialogue with user → write specs / user stories / test cases / phases to Kanbantic → transition issue to `Prepared` so it surfaces in the Prepared kanban-column for claim_issue.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the kanbantic-issue-prepare skill to work this issue out until it's claimable."

## Scope

This skill owns the **Triaged → Prepared** transition. It does NOT:

- Create new issues — that is the job of the intake skills (`kanbantic-feature-request`, `kanbantic-epic-proposal`, `kanbantic-bug-report`). If the user proposes a completely new idea mid-dialogue, the skill points them at the right intake skill and stops.
- Change issue status to `InProgress` — that is the job of `kanbantic-issue-execute` (which now claims directly from `Prepared` via `claim_issue`, atomically promoting status to `InProgress` per KBT-RL052).

If the readiness-gate is still not green at the end of a run, the issue stays on `Triaged` (no transition) and the skill reports which checks are still failing — the user re-runs the skill once the missing artifacts are added.

## Checklist

1. **Gate-check** — verify issue is Triaged (HARD GATE)
2. **Load issue context** — issue, linked specs, test cases, user stories, readiness-checks
3. **Load shared project knowledge** — Toolkit (ClaudeMd, Rules, Patterns, Gotchas) + Library (Architecture)
4. **Route on `issue.type`**:
   - **Feature** → Step 5F (requirements-dialoog)
   - **Bug** → Step 5B (root-cause-dialoog)
   - **Epic** → Step 5E (requirements + implementation plan, sequentieel)
5. **Validate readiness** — re-check `isReadyToClaim`; report failing checks or confirm ready
6. **Record Decision entry** — summary of what was added in this run
7. **Handoff** — instruct user to invoke `kanbantic-issue-execute`

<HARD-GATE>
Step 1 blocks execution when the issue is not Triaged:

- `New` → redirect to `kanbantic-issue-triage` and stop
- `InProgress`, `Review`, `Done`, `Cancelled` → stop and ask the user what they want (prepare is not a re-work skill)

Only Triaged issues are accepted.
</HARD-GATE>

<HARD-GATE>
This skill must NEVER call `create_issue` for unrelated new ideas. If during the dialogue the user brings up a completely new, unrelated idea, the skill says:

> "Dit lijkt een nieuw issue. Gebruik `kanbantic-feature-request`, `kanbantic-epic-proposal` of `kanbantic-bug-report` om het aan te maken, en kom daarna terug naar prepare."

Then the skill stops.

**Epic-route exception (v2.4.0, KBT-F250):** When preparing an `Epic` in the new Phase-of-Features-of-Tasks shape, the skill MAY call `create_issue` to mint child-`Feature`s that fall **within the Epic's already-defined scope**. Those Features must be (a) parented to the Epic via `parentIssueId` at creation, (b) immediately assigned to a Phase via `assign_feature_to_phase`, and (c) covered by the Epic's existing description / acceptance criteria — no scope expansion, no unrelated work.

Allowed MCP writes are: `create_specification`, `create_test_case`, `create_user_story`, `create_phase`, `add_task`, `add_discussion_entry`, `create_implementation_plan`, `update_issue` (for description clarification), `assign_feature_to_phase`, `assign_features_to_phase`, and — under the Epic-route exception only — `create_issue` for in-scope child-Features.
</HARD-GATE>

## Step 0: Ensure Repository Access

Before starting, verify you have local access to the workspace's code repository:

1. Run `git remote -v` to check if you're in a git repository
2. If already in the correct repository, skip to Step 1
3. **No git repo at all (Cowork/desktop, MCP-only run):** prepare reads the codebase only for context and never writes code. When there is no git repository in this environment, **skip the clone entirely** and proceed with MCP-only artifact work (specs, test cases, decisions). This is the context-aware path of the decision rule `shouldEnforceWorktreeGate` in `plugin/scripts/gate-context.js` (`hasGitRepo: false` → gate not enforced). Record the skip as a Comment discussion-entry (see Step 0.5), mirroring the `KANBANTIC_SKIP_GIT_SYNC` opt-out pattern.
4. If no repository or wrong repository (and a repo IS available to clone):
   ```
   MCP: mcp__kanbantic__list_repositories(workspaceId)
   ```
   Pick the repo linked to the issue's `applicationId`, or the first active repository.
   ```
   MCP: mcp__kanbantic__get_repository(repositoryId)
   ```
   Then clone via the bundled credential helper so the PAT is fetched just-in-time
   and never persisted to `.git/config` or this transcript — do **not** embed the
   token in the URL or call `get_repository_credential` yourself (see KBT-B330).
   Read-only access is enough for prepare; stay on the default branch:
   ```bash
   HELPER="!node \"$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/kanbantic-git-credential-helper.js\""
   git clone \
     -c credential.helper="$HELPER" \
     -c kanbantic.repositoryId="<repositoryId>" \
     https://github.com/<org>/<repo>.git
   cd <repo>
   git config credential.helper "$HELPER"
   git config kanbantic.repositoryId "<repositoryId>"
   git checkout main && git pull
   ```

<IMPORTANT>
Prepare does not create branches or commits. It only reads the codebase for context and writes to Kanbantic via MCP.
</IMPORTANT>

## Step 0.5: Worktree HARD-GATE (context-aware)

<HARD-GATE>
This gate is **context-aware** per the decision rule `shouldEnforceWorktreeGate({ hasGitRepo, touchesFilesystem })` in `plugin/scripts/gate-context.js` (KBT-F447). Evaluate it first:

- **No git repository in this environment** (`hasGitRepo: false` — Cowork/desktop, MCP-only run) → **skip the gate**. There is no main-tree/worktree distinction to protect.
- **In a git repo but this is an MCP-only run** (`touchesFilesystem: false` — prepare only reads the codebase and writes Kanbantic artifacts via MCP, no branches/commits/temp files) → **skip the gate**.
- **In a git repo and the run touches the filesystem/code** (`hasGitRepo: true && touchesFilesystem: true`) → **enforce the gate** (below).

When you **skip** the gate, log it as a Comment discussion-entry — a mirror of the existing `KANBANTIC_SKIP_GIT_SYNC` opt-out pattern (KBT-F238):

```
MCP: mcp__kanbantic__add_discussion_entry(issueId, entryType: "Comment",
  content: "Worktree HARD-GATE skipped: <no git repository in this environment | MCP-only run, no filesystem/code work>. Decision per shouldEnforceWorktreeGate (gate-context.js, KBT-F447). Mirrors the KANBANTIC_SKIP_GIT_SYNC opt-out.")
```

When the gate is **enforced**, verify you are **not** in the main working tree. Agents often run in parallel on the same clone; prepare may write code instructions and temporary files — working in the main tree on a feature branch risks conflicts with other concurrent agents.

```bash
GIT_DIR=$(git rev-parse --git-dir)
GIT_COMMON=$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)
if [ "$GIT_DIR" = "$GIT_COMMON" ]; then
  STOP. Report to user verbatim:
  "You are in the main working tree ($GIT_COMMON).
  Run EnterWorktree(name: '<ISSUE-CODE>') first, then re-run this skill.
  See KBT-TRUL004 for the rationale."
fi
```

`<ISSUE-CODE>` is the code of the issue this skill is processing (e.g. `KBT-F123`).

**No opt-out, no override on the enforced path.** Once the gate applies (real code work in a repo), it is a working-tree safety check, not a readiness-artifact check. Working in the main tree is wrong even if the specific bullet reasons don't apply right now — parallel agents are the norm, not the exception. The skip is permitted **only** for the no-repo / MCP-only paths above; it never weakens the code-in-a-repo path.

If the gate is enforced and the check passes (paths differ → you are in a worktree), continue silently.
</HARD-GATE>

## Step 1: Gate-check — Triaged

```
MCP: mcp__kanbantic__get_issue(issueId)
```

- If `status != "Triaged"` → stop per the HARD-GATE above.
- If the issue already satisfies `isReadyToClaim == true` and has all artifacts the type requires (see Step 5 per type), tell the user the issue is already fully prepared and offer to hand off to `kanbantic-issue-execute`.

## Step 2: Load Issue Context

```
MCP: mcp__kanbantic__list_specifications(workspaceId)
MCP: mcp__kanbantic__list_test_cases(issueId)
MCP: mcp__kanbantic__list_discussion_entries(issueId)
```

Read:
- Issue description (from Step 1)
- Linked specifications (existing ones — may already be there from intake or a previous prepare-run)
- Test cases already linked
- Any existing Decision / Comment / Question entries

## Step 3: Load Shared Project Knowledge

```
MCP: mcp__kanbantic__list_toolkit_items(workspaceId, category: "ClaudeMd")
MCP: mcp__kanbantic__list_toolkit_items(workspaceId, category: "Pattern")
MCP: mcp__kanbantic__list_toolkit_items(workspaceId, category: "Gotcha")
MCP: mcp__kanbantic__list_toolkit_items(workspaceId, category: "Rule")
MCP: mcp__kanbantic__list_library_documents(workspaceId, categoryType: "Architecture")
```

Read ClaudeMd first — that contains CLAUDE.md-style guidance that applies to any work in the workspace. Then Rules, Patterns, Gotchas. Read the most relevant Library (Architecture) documents if the issue touches those areas.

<IMPORTANT>
Do not launch broad Explore agents. Use targeted reads (Glob, Grep, Read) for specific files the issue mentions or that are referenced by relevant Toolkit patterns.
</IMPORTANT>

## Step 4: Route on `issue.type`

Dispatch based on `issue.type`:

- `Feature` → Step 5F
- `Bug` → Step 5B
- `Epic` → Step 5E

For any other type, stop and report: "Unknown issue type `<type>`. Prepare supports Feature, Bug, and Epic only."

## Step 5F: Feature — Requirements Dialogue

Goal: end with enough `ProductRequirement` / `SystemRequirement` / `Rule` / `Boundary` specs + test cases + at least one user story so `isReadyToClaim == true`.

### 5F.1: Clarify purpose

Ask questions one at a time (multiple-choice via `AskUserQuestion` where possible):

- What problem does this feature solve?
- Who uses it and how?
- What's in scope? What's explicitly out of scope?
- Performance / compatibility / existing-pattern constraints?
- Success criteria?

### 5F.2: Propose approaches

Present 2–3 approaches with trade-offs (complexity, performance, maintainability). Lead with your recommendation.

### 5F.3: Design sections

Scale sections to complexity: Data model / Backend logic / Frontend UI / MCP integration. Ask after each section: "Ziet dit er goed uit?" / "Does this look right?"

### 5F.4: Write user story, specs, test cases

Per requirement:
```
MCP: mcp__kanbantic__create_user_story(workspaceId, issueId, ...)
MCP: mcp__kanbantic__create_specification(
  workspaceId, category: "ProductRequirement" | "SystemRequirement" | "SecurityRequirement" | "Rule" | "Boundary",
  title, content, extractedFromIssueId: issueId
)
MCP: mcp__kanbantic__create_test_case(
  workspaceId, title, description, steps, expectedResult,
  issueId, priority
)
```

Test-case test-levels should aim for Unit + Integration + E2E coverage where sensible.

### 5F.5: Test-policy declaratie (Regel E / KBT-F442)

Declare the per-level test-policy for this Feature **before transitioning to Prepared**. The physical database-freeze happens when `kanbantic-issue-execute` calls `claim_issue`, but the declaration must be captured now as a `Decision` entry so the executing agent and reviewer can both read it.

Determine per level:

| Niveau | Standaard | N.v.t.-uitzondering |
|---|---|---|
| **Unit** | Vereist / min 1 | Alleen als er nul logische code-paden zijn (bijv. puur data-migratie, DTO-only) |
| **Integration** | Vereist / min 1 | Alleen bij pure client-side issues zonder service-/DB-aanroepen |
| **E2E** | Vereist / min 1 (real-proxy voor plugin; Playwright voor UI) | Geen UI-oppervlak EN geen publieke API-oppervlak (pure domain-logica / parser / achtergrondtaak) |

Rules:
- Default alle drie niveaus naar **Vereist / minimum 1**.
- N.v.t. vereist een **rationale van ≥20 chars** die verklaart waarom het niveau niet van toepassing is.
- Zet **niet** alle drie op N.v.t. — minstens één niveau moet Vereist zijn.
- Deze declaratie vervangt KBT-TRUL013 (opgeheven per KBT-F449).

```
MCP: mcp__kanbantic__add_discussion_entry(
  issueId,
  content: "## Test-policy (bevroren bij claim_issue — KBT-F442 / Regel E)\n\n| Niveau | Applicabiliteit | Minimum |\n|---|---|---|\n| Unit | Vereist | <N> |\n| Integration | Vereist | <N> |\n| E2E | Vereist | <N> |\n\n_N.v.t.-rationale (indien van toepassing per niveau):_ <reden ≥20 chars>",
  entryType: "Decision"
)
```

### 5F.6: Decision entry

```
MCP: mcp__kanbantic__add_discussion_entry(
  issueId, content: <design summary with chosen approach and rationale>,
  entryType: "Decision"
)
```

Go to Step 6.

## Step 5B: Bug — Root-Cause Dialogue

Goal: end with a reproducible bug, a clear hypothesis (or confirmed root cause) captured in a Comment entry, and at least one regression test case.

<HARD-GATE>
NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST. If the user wants a quick fix, push back: prepare produces the understanding, `kanbantic-issue-execute` produces the fix.
</HARD-GATE>

### 5B.1: Reproduce

Ask:
- Steps to reproduce (exact sequence)?
- Expected vs actual?
- Can you trigger it reliably? If not, gather more data before guessing.

### 5B.2: Investigate — the four phases

1. **Read error messages carefully** — stack traces, line numbers, error codes
2. **Check recent changes** — `git log --oneline -20` (on main) to see what changed
3. **Check known gotchas** — from the Toolkit loaded in Step 3
4. **Trace data flow** — where does the bad value originate? Fix at source, not symptom

### 5B.3: Pattern analysis

- Find similar working code
- List every difference between working and broken
- Identify dependencies

### 5B.4: Hypothesis

Form a testable hypothesis: "I think X is the root cause because Y." Capture in a `Comment` discussion entry so `kanbantic-issue-execute` can verify it.

### 5B.5: Regression test case

Create at least one test case covering the failing scenario:
```
MCP: mcp__kanbantic__create_test_case(
  workspaceId,
  title: "Regression: [bug description]",
  description: "Verifies that [bug] is fixed",
  steps: "[steps to verify]",
  expectedResult: "[expected behavior after fix]",
  issueId, priority: "High"
)
```

### 5B.6: Test-policy declaratie (Regel E / KBT-F442)

Declare the per-level test-policy for this Bug **before transitioning to Prepared**. Same rules as 5F.5 — defaults all three levels to Vereist/min=1; N.v.t. requires ≥20-char rationale.

For bugs, the E2E level typically maps to the applicable stack from the issue's application (Playwright for UI-bugs, real-proxy for plugin-bugs, integration-style for API-bugs without UI surface).

```
MCP: mcp__kanbantic__add_discussion_entry(
  issueId,
  content: "## Test-policy (bevroren bij claim_issue — KBT-F442 / Regel E)\n\n| Niveau | Applicabiliteit | Minimum |\n|---|---|---|\n| Unit | Vereist | <N> |\n| Integration | Vereist | <N> |\n| E2E | Vereist | <N> |\n\n_N.v.t.-rationale (indien van toepassing per niveau):_ <reden ≥20 chars>",
  entryType: "Decision"
)
```

### 5B.7: Decision entry

```
MCP: mcp__kanbantic__add_discussion_entry(
  issueId,
  content: "## Root cause hypothesis\n\n**Symptom:** ...\n**Hypothesis:** ...\n**Evidence:** ...\n**Proposed fix direction (not yet implemented):** ...",
  entryType: "Decision"
)
```

Go to Step 6.

## Step 5E: Epic — Sequential Design + Implementation Plan

<HARD-GATE>
For Epics, Steps 5E.1–5E.4 (design) and 5E.5–5E.9 (plan) MUST run in sequence within the same skill-run. Splitting across two invocations leaves the Epic half-prepared and produces a stuck Triaged state. If the skill is interrupted, the user restarts it from the top.
</HARD-GATE>

### Epic Implementation Plan: two shapes (KBT-PR199, KBT-F250)

An Epic's Implementation Plan can take **two shapes**:

| Shape | Hierarchie | Wanneer |
|---|---|---|
| **New (default, v2.4.0+)** | Epic → Phase → Feature → Task | All Epics generated by this skill from v2.4.0 onwards |
| **Legacy** | Epic → Phase → Task (no intermediate Feature) | Existing Epics generated before v2.4.0 |

Why the new shape:
- Each capability gets its own audit-trail (status, specs, test cases, discussion-entries) instead of being administratively closed via `overrideReason`.
- Roll-up is explicit: all Tasks of a Feature Done → Feature Done → all Features of a Phase Done → Phase ready-for-review → all Phases Approved → Epic Review-ready.
- Foundation-werk (cross-cutting Tasks like DI-wiring or DB-migrations) is captured in a dedicated `<Epic>-Foundation` Feature in Phase 1 — no "loose Tasks" directly under a Phase.

Backward compatibility: existing legacy-shape Epics keep working without restructuring. `kanbantic-issue-execute` auto-detects the shape per Phase (KBT-RL057). For new Epics, **always use the new shape** unless the operator explicitly requests legacy.

### 5E.1–5E.3: Requirements dialogue

Same as Step 5F.1–5F.3 but applied at Epic scope (wider purpose, broader trade-offs). At the end of this dialogue you should have a clear list of capabilities the Epic must deliver — those become the **Features** in Step 5E.7.

### 5E.4: Write Epic-level user stories and specs

Write user stories and specifications at Epic scope — at least one user story per high-level capability and the requisite specs:

```
MCP: mcp__kanbantic__create_user_story(workspaceId, issueId, ...)
MCP: mcp__kanbantic__create_specification(
  workspaceId, category: "ProductRequirement" | "SystemRequirement" | "SecurityRequirement" | "Rule" | "Boundary",
  title, content, extractedFromIssueId: issueId
)
```

<HARD-GATE>
Do **NOT** call `create_test_case` with the Epic's `issueId`. Test cases belong to the child Features, not the Epic. Each child Feature gets its own test cases when it is prepared (via `kanbantic-issue-triage` + `kanbantic-issue-prepare` on that Feature). Writing test cases on an Epic violates Regel A (KBT-E084 / KBT-F449) and produces untraceable coverage gaps that the review-gate cannot enforce.
</HARD-GATE>

### 5E.5: Create implementation plan

```
MCP: mcp__kanbantic__create_implementation_plan(
  issueId, title: "<Issue Code> Implementation Plan"
)
```

### 5E.6: Design phases (groupings of Features)

Group **Features** (capabilities) into logical phases — a Phase is a sprint-like grouping of Features that ship together. Typical Epic: 2–4 Phases × 1–3 Features per Phase. Dependencies first: foundation Phase → core capabilities → polish/integration.

```
MCP: mcp__kanbantic__create_phase(
  issueId, name: "<phase name>", description: "<which Features this Phase groups + why>"
)
```

Phase names should describe the milestone, e.g. `"Phase 1 — Foundation"`, `"Phase 2 — Core capabilities"`, `"Phase 3 — Integration & polish"`. The description should mention which Features will live in this Phase.

### 5E.7: Create or assign Features per Phase

For each Phase:

1. **List candidate Features** that belong in this Phase. These come from the requirements dialogue in 5E.1–5E.3 — each capability becomes one Feature.
2. **For each Feature** (foundation-Feature first if applicable):
   - **If the Feature does NOT yet exist as a child-Issue of the Epic** → create it (Epic-route exception):
     ```
     MCP: mcp__kanbantic__create_issue(
       workspaceId,
       type: "Feature",
       title: "<capability name>",
       parentIssueId: <Epic ID>,
       applicationId: <Epic.applicationId>,
       VersionId:    <Epic.VersionId>,
       initiativeId: <Epic.initiativeId>,
       priority: <inherits from Epic or set explicitly>,
       description: "<concrete scope of this Feature within the Epic>"
     )
     ```
     The new Feature lands in `New` status. The skill **does not** triage or prepare it — that's a follow-up the operator runs `kanbantic-issue-triage` + `kanbantic-issue-prepare` on later for each child Feature.
   - **If the Feature already exists** as a child of the Epic (e.g. created during Epic-proposal intake or via `kanbantic-feature-request` linked to the Epic) → just reference its ID.
3. **Assign the Feature to the Phase**:
   ```
   MCP: mcp__kanbantic__assign_feature_to_phase(featureId, phaseId)
   ```
   Or, for many Features in the same Phase:
   ```
   MCP: mcp__kanbantic__assign_features_to_phase(phaseId, featureIds: [...])
   ```

**Foundation-Feature (recommended for Phase 1):** If the Epic involves cross-cutting changes that don't map cleanly to a single user-facing capability (DB-migrations, DI-wiring, shared types, etc.), create one Feature named `"<Epic-Code>-Foundation"` (e.g. `"KBT-E060-Foundation"`) and assign it to Phase 1. Cross-cutting Tasks live there — never as loose Tasks under a Phase.

### 5E.8: Create Tasks per Feature + code instructions per Phase

For each Feature created/assigned in 5E.7, add the actual work-items as Tasks **on the Feature, not on the Epic or Phase**:

```
MCP: mcp__kanbantic__add_task(
  issueId: <featureId>,    // ← TASK ATTACHES TO THE FEATURE
  title: "<work item>",
  description: "<exact what to code>",
  priority: <Critical|High|Medium|Low>
)
```

**Important:** in the new shape, do NOT pass `phaseId` to `add_task`. The Phase-membership is conveyed through the Feature's `PhaseId` (set in 5E.7), not through the Task. Mixing legacy direct-Task-on-Phase with new-shape Feature-on-Phase produces a "mixed-shape" error in `kanbantic-issue-execute` (KBT-RL057).

Per Phase (not per Feature), add a `KnowledgeExtraction` discussion entry on the **Epic** with complete code instructions for the Phase as a whole — this gives the executing agent the full picture of what to build:

- Files to modify/create (exact paths)
- Code snippets showing what to add/change per Feature
- Line numbers where changes go
- Build/test commands to verify
- Expected results

```
MCP: mcp__kanbantic__add_discussion_entry(
  issueId: <Epic ID>,
  content: <full code instructions in Markdown, organised by Feature within this Phase>,
  entryType: "KnowledgeExtraction"
)
```

### 5E.9: Decision entry

Summarize Phase breakdown, the Features per Phase, key architectural choices, and the rationale.

```
MCP: mcp__kanbantic__add_discussion_entry(
  issueId, content: <summary>, entryType: "Decision"
)
```

Example summary:
```
## Implementation Plan summary
- Phase 1 — Foundation: KBT-F261 (Foundation), KBT-F262 (Database migration)
- Phase 2 — Core capabilities: KBT-F263, KBT-F264, KBT-F265
- Phase 3 — Integration: KBT-F266 (Frontend wiring)

Rationale: Phase 1 isolates the schema change so we can deploy it ahead of the
core capabilities. Phase 2 ships the user-facing flows in one batch so the
review-step can verify them together. Phase 3 wires the new flows to the UI.
```

Go to Step 6.

## Step 6: Validate Readiness

```
MCP: mcp__kanbantic__get_issue(issueId)
```

Re-inspect `readinessChecks` for the `Triaged → Prepared` transition. The `isReadyToClaim` boolean on the DTO is now derived from `Status == Prepared` (KBT-SR266) — at this point it is still `false`; that flips to `true` after Step 6a transitions the issue.

### 6.0: Version readiness — informational (KBT-F318 / KBT-RL144)

As an **informational, non-gating** check, verify the issue's Application has a **Planned** Version it can claim against. This is a heads-up for `kanbantic-issue-execute`, whose claim-gate (KBT-RL145) is the actual enforcement point.

```
MCP: mcp__kanbantic__list_versions(workspaceId)   // live version tool; filter to issue.applicationId + status == "Planned"
```

- **A Planned Version exists** and the issue already carries a `VersionId` of the **same** Application → report `Version: <name> ✓`.
- **A Planned Version exists** but the issue carries a `VersionId` of a **different** Application → warn (KBT-RL144 scope-mismatch); recommend re-running triage to fix the Version. Do **not** block the Prepared transition on this.
- **No Planned Version** for the Application → warn: `ℹ️ Application <X> heeft nog geen Planned Version — kanbantic-issue-execute zal de claim blokkeren tot er één is (gebruik preview_next_version + create_version).` This is informational only; it does **not** stop the Prepared transition.

### 6a: All checks green — transition to Prepared

```
MCP: mcp__kanbantic__update_issue_status(issueId, status: "Prepared")
```

The backend evaluates `Triaged → Prepared` readiness (KBT-RL051): all required checks must be green, otherwise a structured `ReadinessGateBlocked` (Hard) or `ReadinessGateSoftBlock` (Soft) BusinessException with `recommendation` is returned — pattern-match on `(missingCondition: ...)` to fix and retry, do not blindly retry.

If the transition succeeds, report:

**"[ISSUE CODE] transitioned to `Prepared`. All readiness checks pass:**
- HasDescription: ✓
- UserStories: ✓ (N linked)
- Specifications: ✓ (N linked)
- TestCases: ✓ (N linked)

**Next step:** Invoke `kanbantic-issue-execute`. It will call `claim_issue(branch: ...)` which atomically assigns the issue and promotes `Prepared → InProgress` in a single MCP call (KBT-RL052)."

### 6b: Some checks still failing

Do **not** call `update_issue_status(Prepared)` — the gate would reject it. The issue stays on `Triaged`. Report exactly which checks are still failing and what's needed; offer to continue the dialogue or stop. Re-run the skill after the missing artifacts are added.

## Step 7: Handoff

If 6a fires: issue is `Prepared`; hand off to `kanbantic-issue-execute`. If 6b fires: issue stays `Triaged` until the missing artifacts are added.

## Key Principles

- **One skill, type-based routing** — the user doesn't choose between design / debugging / planning
- **Triaged → Prepared**, nothing more, nothing less (KBT-F235)
- **Never create new issues** — intake skills do that
- **Epics are sequential design+plan in one run** — leaving a half-prepared Epic is a failure mode
- **Root cause before fix (Bug)** — prepare captures understanding, execute captures the fix
- **Readiness gate is the exit criterion** — the skill is done when `isReadyToClaim == true`
- **Kanbantic is source of truth** — everything persists via MCP
